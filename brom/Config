# Make the bootloader pause before attempting to load the first KBs of
# the disk image. The bootloader will wait for any input on the PTY.
# Useful for debugging in some cases.
#
# Note that there's a bit of a bug in the VUART where a signal (i.e a
# debug CTRL-z - A.K.A SIGTSTP) will cause the underlying read() syscall
# to be interrupted and return. Thus when we exit the debugger via run
# the system will boot.
